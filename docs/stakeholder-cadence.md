# Phase 1.6 — Stakeholder Cadence & Ownership

Roadmap item 1.6 requires establishing a consistent stakeholder alignment rhythm and naming the charter owner responsible for updating decisions and actions. This document records the cadence, participants, and communication expectations.

## 1. Cadence Overview
- **Bi-Weekly Stakeholder Sync (45 minutes):** Reviews roadmap progress, KPI trends, risks, and blockers. Occurs every other Tuesday at 10:00 AM local SecOps time.
- **Monthly Executive Summary (30 minutes):** Presents highlights and asks for leadership decisions; run on the first Thursday of each month.
- **RFC Review Window:** Major changes submitted as RFCs must circulate for 7 calendar days; default to asynchronous review but reserve ad-hoc meetings for contentious topics.

## 2. Participants
| Role | Name (TBD) | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Charter Owner / Product Owner | SecOps Lead | Maintains roadmap, documents decisions, drives prioritization. |
| Technical Lead | Identity Security Engineer | Provides technical status, manages engineering backlog. |
| Automation Engineer(s) | PowerShell Developers | Demo scripts/playbooks, raise implementation risks. |
| Incident Commander | IR Lead | Validates playbooks, escalates operational concerns. |
| Compliance Liaison | GRC Analyst | Confirms policy alignment, tracks audit actions. |
| Executive Sponsor | CISO delegate | Resolves escalations, ensures organizational support. |
| Optional Guests | Ticketing/Automation platform owners, Identity admins | Join as needed for specific roadmap topics. |

## 6. Tooling & Documentation

## 7. Next Steps
- Assign concrete names to each role once stakeholders are confirmed.
- Create calendar invites with virtual meeting details and attach the agenda template.
- Spin up the collaboration channel and seed with roadmap, KPI baseline, and charter documents.
- Kick off the first bi-weekly sync immediately after Phase 1 sign-off.
