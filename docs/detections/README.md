# MFA Check & Steer — Detection Library Overview

The detection library is developed during Phase 4 to help SecOps analysts quickly identify risky MFA configurations and suspicious activity. This folder tracks detection design docs, rule specifications, and testing artifacts.

## Folder Structure
- `rules/` — Individual detection specifications (YAML/Markdown) describing logic, data sources, severity, and runbooks.
- `playbooks/` — Response guidance mapped to detections (will be filled in Phase 5).
- `tests/` — Sample inputs and expected detection outputs for automated validation.

## Conventions
- Every detection has an ID formatted as `MFA-DET-###`.
- Severity scale: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`.
- Rules must document required data sources (e.g., canonical sign-ins, registration inventories).
- Where possible, detection logic should operate on normalized data generated by `Get-MfaEntraSignIn -Normalize` and `Get-MfaEntraRegistration -Normalize`.

Refer to `docs/detections/detection-strategy.md` for the overarching philosophy and acceptance criteria.
