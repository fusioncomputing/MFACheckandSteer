# MFA Check & Steer

This repository will host MFA Check & Steer, a project focused on tooling and guidance around multi-factor authentication validation and remediation workflows. The project is just getting started; see `agents.md` for the Codex agent's operating notes on the Windows environment.

## Getting Started
- Ensure you have PowerShell 7+ available; all examples will assume PowerShell unless otherwise specified.
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/fusioncomputing/MFACheckandSteer.git`.
- Review `roadmap.md` for the current development plan and `agents.md` for implementation guidance tailored to Windows.

More detailed setup instructions and automation scripts will land once the technical direction is finalized.
