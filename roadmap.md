# MFA Check & Steer — Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Planning (in progress)
- Confirm project scope, target platforms, and success metrics with stakeholders.
- Select the primary implementation stack (language, frameworks, deployment model).
- Define security and compliance requirements for handling MFA artifacts.
- Draft repository conventions: directory layout, coding standards, Windows-compatible tooling.

## Phase 1 — Scaffolding
- Scaffold the core service/application structure once technology decisions are locked.
- Add baseline automation: linting, formatting, and test harness with PowerShell-friendly commands.
- Establish CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) with Windows runners to mirror the primary development environment.

## Phase 2 — Core Features
- Implement MFA policy ingestion and validation logic.
- Build remediation recommendations/automation hooks.
- Provide telemetry and audit logging aligned with compliance requirements.

## Phase 3 — UX & Integration
- Deliver CLI and/or UI workflows tailored for ops engineers.
- Integrate with external identity providers and ticketing systems as required.
- Author comprehensive documentation and runbooks.

## Phase 4 — Hardening & Release
- Conduct security reviews, penetration testing, and performance tuning.
- Finalize release packaging, upgrade path, and long-term maintenance plan.
- Gather feedback from pilot users and schedule GA launch activities.
